About Glovebox
--------------

Glovebox is the project name for the suite of programs and libraries suitable
for use in a car computing environment. The suite is optimized for use with a
low-powered computer system and a touchscreen. It is meant to run with
Qt/Embedded Linux, but normal Qt works just fine. That means that anywhere Qt
runs, Glovebox can run.

Licensing
---------
The Glovebox project is generally covered under version 3 of the GNU Public
License. Individual components may have different licenses, so when in doubt,
check the individual files.

Hardware Recomendations
----------------------
As Glovebox's use is intended for that of an in-car assistant, a small, low
horsepower computer is all that is needed. 256MB of RAM, a small solid state
disk, 1GHz CPU, and a cheap graphics chip should work just fine.

Build Requirements
-----------------
To build Glovebox, it is recommended to build in a separate build directory.
The build system is CMake, so all you have to do is run
``cmake ../glovebox-source/'' from your build directory, expanding as needed.
If you are building for Qt/Embedded linux, be sure that you set your PATH
variable to the proper location.

Bugs
----
None yet. The project is too small to have any :)

But when they do crop up, a bug tracker will be up somewhere.
